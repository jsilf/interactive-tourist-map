## Description

The idea of the project was to create a way for tourists to gain more knowledge about fun and interesting things to do when visiting the island.  
It consists of a interactive map with checkboxes to toggle markers and information popping up on clicking a marker, information about the island and external links to other useful information.

This project was made as my final degree project for my education at Medieinstitutet.  
I learned more about React, TypeScript, Node.js, MongoDB, Figma, how to plan + execute a project, and more, over the course of this project.

The design, logo and icons were made by me in Figma. All the images are also mine.
